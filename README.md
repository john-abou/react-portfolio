## Description
This is my first React.js application, I found making my own React app helped me to understand how to use components and JSX. In the making of my portfolio I also had the opportunity to practice more of my front-end design skills. I think I have a lot more to learn in that regard and I plan to update this portfolio and improve the design. 

## Deployment

## Installation
* Clone the repository locally.
* After installation, run "npm install" to install all dependencies. Then, run npm "build" to build a local copy of the application, you can then open the HTML with a live server.*

## Usage
You can use my application to view my portfolio, leave me a message, learn more about me and some of the projects I've worked on. Please feel free to email me if you'd like to connect or collaborate on a project. I'm always looking to learn new things and meet new people.
