## Description
This is my first React.js application, I found making my own React app helped me to understand how to use components and JSX. In the making of my portfolio I also had the opportunity to practice more of my front-end design skills. I think I have a lot more to learn in that regard and I plan to update this portfolio and improve the design. 

## Installation
It can be installed from my github. After installation, run "npm install" to install all dependencies. Then, run npm "build" to build a local copy of the application, you can then open the HTML with a live server.

## Usage
You can use my application to view my portfolio, leave me a message, learn more about me and some of the projects I've worked on.
